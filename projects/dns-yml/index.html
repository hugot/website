<header>DNS YAML</header>

<p>
 DNS YAML is infrastructure of code for the management of authoritative DNS
 records. It allows its users to create yaml files describing the desired state
 of their authoritative DNS records, which can then be applied to their DNS
 server. DNS YAML does this through a concept called "mappers", which are
 adapters that are able to interact with different types of authoritative DNS
 solutions. The currently supported mappers are:
</p>

<table>
 <tr><td><b>powerdns</b></td><td>Maps to a powerdns mysql database.</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>scaleway</b></td><td>Maps to the scaleway DNS service.</td></tr>
 <tr><td><b>dry</b></td><td>Reads in the document and checks if it's valid
   without actually mapping to anything.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
 The software can be obtained from the
  <a href="https://github.com/hugot/dns-yml">source code repository</a>  or
  as a docker image from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/hugotty/dns-yml">docker hub</a>.

   If you're just managing your personal infrastructure and want to have a way to
   manage the state of your DNS within the same version control repository as your
   ansible scripts, DNS YAML will be the missing piece of the puzzle for you.

   While it hasn't been tested in large deployments, I think that this DNS YAML
   could be a great addition for large bodies of people who work on applications
   within the same infrastructure. Traditionally, DNS records are managed by
   sysadmins who edit zone files by hand, or through self-service UIs that some
   employees are allowed to acces. If one were to, in stead, use version
   controlled DNS YAML documents in combination with CI/CD, the following things
   would be achieved:
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li>
    Employees can create pull requests with DNS record changes that their
    projects require. These could be reviewed and merged by employees who are
    responsible for infrastructure, after which they can be applied to
    staging/production environments through the CI/CD system.
   </li>
   <li>
    The state of the DNS is reproducible. If the DNS service were to fail and
    its state was lost, it would be trivial to replace it and reapply its state
    with the DNS YAML document.
   </li>
   <li>
    Changes to DNS records are autidable through version control.
   </li>
   <li>
    Lastly, but not unimportantly, automated CI jobs could be setup for DNS YAML
    repositories to scan for stale DNS records that point to infrastructure that
    is no longer under the companies control. This is important, because leaving
    stale records unattended can be a security risk. Take A records that point
    to IP addresses that are not controlled by the company anymore for
    example. Those could be abused by bad actors who want to impersonate the
    company if they were to get their hands on that old IP address.
   </li>

 <header>An Example</header>
 <p>
  To help you get an idea, here is an example of a DNS YAML document, with below
  it a Done CI file that could be used to check the document for validity and
  apply it to production. The document contains examples of the different types
  of record values that DNS YAML allows to be configured, which
  are <code>raw</code>, <code>file</code> or <code>round-robin</code>.

  Below is a Drone CI pipeline configuration that validates the documents by
  using the <code>dry</code> mapper and then applies the document to production
  through the scaleway DNS service API using the <code>scaleway</code> mapper.
