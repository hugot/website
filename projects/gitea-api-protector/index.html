<header>Gitea API Protector</header>
<p>
 I built the Gitea API Protector in response to a request for help that
 maintainers of <a href="https://codeberg.org">codeberg.org</a> put out on the
 fediverse in january of 2020. Codeberg was (and probably still is) one of the
 largest public <a href="https://gitea.io">gitea</a>  instances and as such was
 having trouble with spam bots that would create spam issues on repositories
 using the API. My solution was to lock new users out of API access and have
 them apply for it through a pull request they could create using the gitea web
 UI. The people from codeberg
 were <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/9847#issuecomment-575799090">interested</a>,
 but in the end they didn't end up going with my solution. Nevertheless the
 software is fully functional and the codebase is small enough for people to
 change it for their own use cases if they so desired.
