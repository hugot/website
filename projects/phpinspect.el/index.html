<p>
 phpinspect is an emacs lisp package that aims to provide emacs with IDE-like
 features for PHP files and projects. Among other things phpinspect provides PHP
 developers with code completion, import management and project navigation
 features. Under the hood is a custom PHP parser that is implemented in 100%
 pure emacs lisp.

 <header>Why?</header>
 <p>
  Over the years I have tried using a plethora of solutions for PHP code
  intelligence within emacs. I tried everything ranging from language server
  implementations to ctags based solutiions, to custom emacs integrations for
  software like phpactor. While some solutions worked fine in some scenarios, all
  of them had problems for my use cases. I encountered performance issues
  (language servers implemented in PHP would have massive memory consumption),
  lack of sophistication (ctags based solutions don't understand object oriented
  code well enough) or simply a lack of features. After a while I got invested
  enough to start implementing a solution myself with the main goals of being
  able to work with large projects, being sophisticated enough to understand
  object oriented code and being simple to setup from within emacs.

 <header>Current Status</header>
 <p>
  While the software is already useful to me in its current state, it needs more
  polish and an overhaul of some features before it's ready for others to try
  out comfortably. That is why I am working towards a
  <a href="https://git.snorba.art/hugo/phpinspect.el/milestone/1">
   <em>ready for fieldtesting milestone</em>
  </a>. I hope to get the project ready for others to try out before the end of
  summer this year (2022).
