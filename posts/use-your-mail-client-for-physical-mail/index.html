            <h1>How To Use Your Email Client For Physical Mail</h1>
            <p>
                Whether it's to re-read a conversation, find a plane ticket I ordered or
                check when a meeting was planned, I often find myself looking up old
                emails. It's usually easy to do so because email clients are designed for
                the task: Many of them support full-text search and some even complement
                that with neat tagging and categorization systems. To be honest I have
                become completely dependent on those features for my day to day
                life. Having full-text search and some sort of categorization for email
                can be a huge time saver. When it comes to physical mail however, I still
                have to browse through stacks of paper to (hopefully) find what I'm
                looking for. I figured that it'd be nice to use my fancy email client to
                deal with physical mail as well, so I found a way to do just that. Turns
                out it's pretty simple!
            </p>

            <p>
                The main objective here is to transform our physical mail into an email
                that can be received, indexed and read by our email client of choice. Now,
                one way to do that would be to type the contents of our mail into an email
                by hand, but <i>ain't nobody got time for that!</i>. The (more appealing)
                alternative is to use a document scanner. I have a single purpose scanner
                unit from Canon that I hook up to my laptop for just this purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
                It isn't as simple as just emailing a scanned document to ourselves
                though: email clients are smart, but they can't understand a word of text
                in our PDF or JPEG of a physical document. They need content to be in
                plain text form in order to provide us with some of their best features
                like full-text search. We'll have to somehow transform our scanned
                documents into plain text that we can include in our email. To do this, we
                can use tesseract. Tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR)
                engine, meaning that it can recognize text in images and extract it for
                us. Installing it should be easy on Debian derivative distros like
                Ubuntu. My laptop is running Debian unstable so I just ran <code>apt
                install tesseract</code> and started using it. Using it is as easy as
                upening up a terminal and typing <code>tesseract FILE.jpg
                OUTPUT</code>. That command will save all the text that tesseract is able
                to recognize in the image FILE.jpg to a file called OUTPUT.txt.
            </p>

                <i>
                    Side note: I am Dutch, so most of my physical mail is in Dutch. To
                    make tesseract better understand my mail I installed the
                    tesseract-ocr-nld package using <code>apt install
                    tesseract-ocr-nld</code>. You can check what other language packs are
                    available by using <code>apt search tesseract-ocr</code>.
                </i>
            </aside>

            <p>
                All we have to do from there is copy-paste the contents of that file into
                an email and send it to ourselves! Depending on the formatting of the
                input document, the output may not always be pleasant to read. We can
                account for this by including the original document as an attachment to
                the email. That way we get the best of both worlds: we can use the search
                functionality of our email client to find the document, and then read it
                in its original form by opening the attachment.
            </p>

                This is all easy enough, but I'm lazy. I didn't feel like opening up my
                email client and doing manual copy-pasting, so I decided to automate the
                process a little further. I have postfix setup on my system to relay to my
                mail server, so I can simply use the <code>mail</code> command to send emails without a
                GUI mail client. I combined that with tesseract in a little bash
                script. The script iterates through all of its arguments and interprets
                them as filenames of scanned documents. It calls tesseract to extract text
                from them, concatenates the results, attaches the files to an email and
                sends it to my personal email address. Now all I have to do is run the
                script with filenames of some documents and my job is done. If anyone is
                interested in an actual program that does the same thing and doesn't
                require you to setup postfix, let me know! I might consider authoring one
                if it's useful to more people than just myself. The script I'm currently
                using can be found <a href="scan-to-mailpile.bash.html">here (pretty)</a>
                and <a href="scan-to-mailpile.bash">here (raw)</a>, but I don't recommend
                using it if you don't fully understand its contents, it's not a polished
                user experience ðŸ¤“.
