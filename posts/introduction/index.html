            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <p>
                Hello, welcome to my blog! My name is Hugo. I am a 22 year old Software Engineering
                student from the Netherlands. Software development is a huge part of my life, I write a
                lot of (weird) programs to scratch my own itch and most software I create
                is <a href="https://github.com/hugot">open source</a> by default. I also run a one-man
                company that provides some IT services on the side.
            </p>

            <p>
                Between working on projects and studying I like to watch movies &amp; series, listen to music
                &amp; podcasts, ride my road bike and take hikes.
            </p>

            <h2>What kind of blog is this?</h2>
            <p>
                Because I'm quite new to this and I want to keep myself interested, I won't be
                limiting myself to a single topic. You can expect me to post about a variety of topics
                that may interest/annoy/excite me at any given moment.
            </p>

            <p>May my posts be interesting and my posting schedule be consistent ðŸ¤“ðŸ––</p>

            <p>I hope to see you around! - Hugo</p>
