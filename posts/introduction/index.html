        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>
            Hello, welcome to my blog! My name is Hugo. I am a 22 year old Software Engineering
            student from the Netherlands. Software development is a huge part of my life, I write a
            lot of (weird) programs to scratch my own itch and most software I create
            is <a href="https://github.com/hugot">open source</a> by default. I also run a one-man
            company that provides some IT services on the side.
        </p>

        <p>
            Between working on projects and studying I like to watch movies &amp; series, listen to music
            &amp; podcasts, ride my road bike and take hikes.
        </p>

        <h2>What kind of blog is this?</h2>
        <p>
            Because I'm quite new to this and I want to keep myself interested, I won't be
            limiting myself to a single topic. You can expect me to post about a variety of topics
            that may interest/annoy/excite me at any given moment.
        </p>

        <p>May my posts be interesting and my posting schedule be consistent ðŸ¤“ðŸ––</p>

        <p>I hope to see you around! - Hugo</p>
