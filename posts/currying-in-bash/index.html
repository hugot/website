   <h1>Closures and Function Currying... in BASH?</h1>
   <p>
    I don't think anyone will disagree with me when I say that GNU BASH is not
    a functional programming language. Some people would probably even argue
    that bash is not a programming language at all. Whatever opinion you may
    have, there is no denying that bash is a damn handy too to have in your
    belt. Today I figured I'd share some functional concepts that have been
    helpful to me when writing scripts in BASH, which is my favorite scripting
    language for workflow automation.
